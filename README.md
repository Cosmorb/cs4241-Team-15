Then we make/get pet images and get egg art

We are planning on using Express, MongoDB, Canvas or Three.js, SVG, and WebAudio API. Through these frameworks, we will be able to create a 2-D egg-hatching game that will succeed where CryptoZoo failed. Our user interface will be themed in 2-D art effects. You can see example designs down below.

About:
We plan on making multiple eggs that can all be hatched into new monsters. There will be an engaging background that will draw users into the world of CryptoZoo. They will find it rewarding through the raising of their egg till it hatches, and it helps you hatch your other eggs. Embark on the path of Crypto Mastery.
